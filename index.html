      <p>Neck pain is a common problem with few solutions. But thanks to The Neck Hammock, that’s about to change. The Neck Hammock brings the miracle of cervical traction to your home in the form of a simple, portable device you can use every day.</p>
      <img src="images/symbols.jpg" alt="Info panel">
      <p>It helps release muscle tension in as little as 10 minutes a day and for less than the cost of a single physical therapy session.</p>

      <p>If you have frequent neck pain or know someone who does, you know it’s not an easy problem to get rid of. Medications simply dull the pain but do not eliminate it. And visits to your physical therapist are costly and time-consuming. Other products have tried to bring neck pain relief home through cervical traction (a light stretching of the neck) but these devices are bulky, hard to operate and often ineffective.</p>
      <img src="images/product2.jpg" alt="Product photo">
      <p>Neck Hammock is the first affordable cervical traction device that does all the hard work for you. All you have to do is lie back and relax.</p>

      <p>The Neck Hammock helps the muscles relax and gradually stretch.</p>
      <img src="images/diagram1.jpg" alt="Diagram">
      <p>This allows for the intervertebral space to expand and allow better blood flow and circulation.</p>
      <img src="images/diagram2.jpg" alt="Diagram">
      <p>Better circulation helps to oxygenate muscles, nerves, tendons, and ligaments which leads to decreased pain and increased mobility.</p>
      <img src="images/diagram3.jpg" alt="Diagram">
      <p>It’s hard to believe that one device could relieve tension headaches, release pinched nerves, reduce herniated discs and relieve overall pressure and yet, that’s exactly what The Neck Hammock does.</p>

      <p>Cervical traction is the process of relaxing and stretching the neck muscles to increase blood flow and circulation. But the problem with most cervical traction devices is that it’s hard to use them consistently.</p>
      <img src="images/product3.jpg" alt="Product photo">
      <p>Neck Hammock makes it easy to treat neck pain consistently, which is the key to curing it. Because it’s portable and only takes 10 minutes to be effective, Neck Hammock is the only cervical traction solution you can (and will want to) use every day.</p>
      <img src="images/affordable.jpg" alt="Description">
      <p>Neck Hammock was created by a licensed physical therapist who saw the need for a product his patients could easily use at home.</p>
      <img src="images/computer.jpg" alt="Computer">
      <p>Because Neck Hammock is backed by science, you can feel comfortable using it just as the doctor ordered.It’s like having a physical therapist with you all the time.</p>
      <img src="images/take.jpg" alt="Description">
      <p>Unlike other devices out there, Neck Hammock is small and portable, so you can take it anywhere with you.<br><br>All you have to do is find a good place to chill, no matter where you are.</p>
      <img src="images/product4.jpg" alt="Product photo">
      <img src="images/sustainable.jpg" alt="Description">
      <p>The problem with many cervical traction treatments is that they cost a lot of time and money. Neck Hammock just requires 10 minutes of your time, and it costs less than the amount of a single physical therapy session.</p>
